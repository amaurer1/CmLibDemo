Color models enable the definition of colors by using three parameters. Besides the device oriented color model RGB, there are the user oriented color models HSV and HSL. In this article, I would like to present the two color models HSG and HSP. HSG applies the theories of the color scientist Harald Kueppers. HSP is a new color model which incorporates the perceived brightness.
